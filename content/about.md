Hi, I'm Andrei! I'm a software engineer and entrepreneur living and working in London.

I work mostly in [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org), Erlang, and Java. I like to throw in [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com) and whatever else will make my life easier.

My main interest is in server-side technology and massive scalability, but I've been known to dabble in native mobile development, user facing web applications and various other projects.

Check out my [GitHub page](https://github.com/zyro) to see what I've been up to recently!
